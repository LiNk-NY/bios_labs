# Basics

R is an object oriented programming language. It works in terms of 'objects'
which are variables that can represent nearly anything. 

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. If you are reading this from the Word document
output, you are not looking at the source code. Open the `Rmd` file. 

In order to create the Word document, you can open the `Rmd` file in `RStudio`.
This allows you to easily create the Word document by clicking on the `Knit`
button at the top of the window. If you click the tiny triangle, you will
see all the options available. Word should be the default based on the header
of this document (i.e., `output: word_document`). Provided that your code
is running, you will be able to 'knit' R code and free text to a Word document
for submission. 

# Installing packages

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("knitr")
```


# Data Types

## Numeric

We use the `c` function to *combine* values into ONE object!

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3)
## inspect the type
class( c(1, 2, 3) )
```

Note. The colon `:` can be used as a shortcut to indicate a sequence of numbers.

## Character

Here we create a character vector of the words for three colors.

```{r}
c("red", "blue", "green")
class( c("red", "blue", "green") )
```

## Logical

A logical vector consists of either `TRUE` or `FALSE` values. These are special
keywords that R can understand to indicate logical conditions. We put these
values into a vector:

```{r}
c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
class( c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) )
```

## Assignment

In order to create an object and manipulate it, we need to hold it in space
and time. We use the `<-` arrow to set the variable "myvar" on the left hand
side.

```{r}
myvar <- c(1, 2, 3)
class(myvar)
```

In the above code, the object "myvar" is set to a vector of numbers (1, 2, and
3). We _always_ use the 'arrow' to __assign__ a variable from a set of values.

```{r}
mysecond <- c("blue", "green", "red")
```

To 'see' a variable, simply run the variable in the console or in a code chunk.

```{r}
myvar
```

__Note.__ Code chunks are *delimited* by a triple backtick and 'r' in brackets:
(*Ignore* the backslashes in this example as they are for printing purposes.


```
\`\`\`{r}
```

and always end in a single line of triple backticks:

```
\`\`\`
```

To get the path of a file from within R, use the `file.choose` function.

```{r,eval = FALSE}
mycsv <- file.choose()
```

In this example 'mycsv' is assigned to the result of the `file.choose`
operation. `mycsv` will contain the path to the file that you chose
through the 'File Explorer' or 'Finder' (if on a Mac).

*Note* that you may also get the path from your operating system's 'File
Explorer' by SHIFT and RIGHT CLICK-ing on the file. This is different if
you're the 'Finder' on a Mac, see the file properties. 

Here we paste the full ('absolute') path of the file: 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
mycsv <- "c:/Users/Documents/mycsvfile.csv"
```

**Note.** Windows users will have paths that are `\` (backslashes) instead of
`/` forward slashes that R requires. You will have to manually change each
one if you don't use the `choose.file()` function.

**Important.** We used `eval=FALSE` in the previous chunk options because we do
not want to run the code for the hypothetical file presented here (reason 
being that it won't work; there is no `mycsvfile.csv`).

## Loading data

In this example, we recommend that both the data and the `Rmd` source file
reside in the same location. Therefore we can use the 'relative' file path
to the file which would simply be the name of the file "birthwt.csv".

Here we use the function `read.csv` to import the data with the __correct__
file path:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## absolute path
read.csv("/cloud/project/data/birthwt.csv")
## relative path
read.csv("birthwt.csv")
## interactive option for an absolute path
file.choose()
```

We assign this to a variable / object in order to work with it. 

```{r}
bwt <- read.csv(file = "birthwt.csv")
head(x = bwt, n = 10)
tail(bwt)
dim(bwt)
class(bwt)
```

We now have a `data.frame` object at our disposal. To see the class use the
class function:

```{r}
class(bwt)
```

### Renaming the columns in data

Here we use the `names` function on the `bwt` dataset and use assignment
to give the new column names.

```{r}
names(bwt) <- c("MID", "Order", "Wt", "Age", "CID") 
head(bwt)
```

A `data.frame` object is a standard representation for data in R. It is quite
versatile in that it allows variables of multiple types (i.e., character,
numeric, logical)

## Preview the data

To see a small slice of the data we use the `head` function on the variable
we just created:

```{r}
head(bwt)
```

## Take a subset of the data

First, we need a condition, e.g., "I only want to restrict to first
born observations". In R, we would use: `Order == 1`. Because `Order` is
the variable in `bwt` and its type is `numeric`. The `==` means "equals"; thus
can be read as "observations where the variable `Order` equals 1".

```{r}
## take a peek at the logical
head( with(bwt, Order == 1) )
## is the same as
head( bwt$Order == 1 )
```

With our condition returning logical corresponding to first born babies, we can
now use the `subset` function:

```{r}
bwt.first <- subset(x = bwt, subset = Order == 1)
```

This can be interpreted as "take a subset of the `bwt` dataset based on only the
first born," i.e., `Order == 1`. 

Equivalently, we can use the square brackets to restrict to the first born in
the data:

```{r}
bwt.first <- bwt[ bwt$Order == 1 , ]
```

In the 'tidyverse' (the suite of packages built around the 'tidy' philosophy),
we can use the operational function / verb `filter` to restrict to the same
set of observations as in previous examples.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
filter(bwt, Order == 1)
```

## Descriptive statistics for numerical variables

```{r}
summary(bwt)
```

## Scatterplot of death rate by age

**Important.** We always use the `$` dollar sign symbol to obtain a single column
from a `data.frame` (`bwt`).

```{r}
plot(bwt.first$Wt, bwt.first$Age)
```

Notice the two inputs are numeric vectors! That means that you will have an
idea with respect to the answer to this operation:

```{r}
class(bwt.first$Age)
```

Note. `"integer"` is the cousin of the `"numeric"` class.

## Regression of death rate on age

```{r}
fit <- lm(Wt ~ Age, data = bwt.first)
summary(fit)
```
