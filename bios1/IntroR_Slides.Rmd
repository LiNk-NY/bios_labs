# Today's class

* R and the RStudio interface
* Basic features of the R language
* Getting started
* Tips
* Getting help and troubleshooting
* External resources

# What is R?

* R is a programming language and environment for statistical computing and
data visualization
* "Base R" refers to the standalone suite of pre-packaged functions that allow
R to function as a language
* Extensions of the R language are what are called "packages"
* A **package** is a container of functions that give R additional flexibility

# What is RStudio?

* IDE Interactive Development Environment
* Four pane layout
* Editor + Console + Environment + Files
* Let's have a look at it!

# R script vs R Markdown

* R script is general language processable by R ("code")
* R scripts have a `.R` file extension
* RMarkdown is a framework for combining code and prose
* RMarkdown documents have a `.Rmd` file extension

# Using R

# How do I get started?

* First download the latest R version from [r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
* Install R with all the default settings
* Download RStudio from [RStudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* RStudio allow you to select the R version installed in your system.

# Recommendations for RStudio setup

* Tools > Global Options
* _Don't_ restore .RData into workspace
* _Never_ save workspace to .RData on exit

# Features of the R Language

* case sensitive!!
* Spaces are ignored (except in names)
* works with functions
* vectorized operations
* objects
* help pages
* `?reserved`

# Recognizing a function

* a name followed by parentheses `help()`
* arguments (e.g., `functionname(argument1 = "default")`)
* input / output

# R Housekeeping tips

* Maintain a clean R "global" environment
* Save your scripts rather than outputs
* Use object names that are descriptive
* Improve readability with clean formatting

# Getting help and troubleshooting

* Critically important
* "Debugging" your script involves:
