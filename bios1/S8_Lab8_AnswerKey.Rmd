# Lab 8 (Challenger O-ring)

## Exercise

Calculate the probability of o-ring failure with the Challenger data at a
temperature of **31** degrees Fahrenheit.

```{r}
library(readxl)
challenger <- read_excel("data/prechallenger.xls")
## a tibble
challenger
```

## Plot the data

Let's visualize the data.

```{r}
with(challenger, plot(temp, damage, axes = FALSE, pch = 16))
axis(side = 2, at = c(0, 1))
axis(side = 1, at = seq(50, 85, by = 5))
```

## Logistic Regression Model

```{r}
fit <- glm(damage ~ temp, data = challenger, family = "binomial")
summary(fit)
```

## Predicting the probability of failure given new data

The temperature when STS 51-L (Challenger) was launched was 31 degrees F.

```{r}
predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(temp = 31), type = "response")
```
